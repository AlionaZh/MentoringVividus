Composite: When I check 5 Summary blocks
When I initialize the SCENARIO variable `counter` with value `0`
When I execute steps while counter is not equal to `5` with increment `1` starting from `0`:
|step|
|When I wait until element located `By.xpath((//a[starts-with(@href,"/detailsPage")])[#{eval(${counter} + 1)}])` appears|
|When I click on element located `By.xpath((//a[starts-with(@href,"/detailsPage")])[#{eval(${counter} + 1)}])`| 
|When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//div[contains(text(),'Summary')])`|
|When I compare against baseline with `Summary`|
|When I navigate back|
|When I initialize the SCENARIO variable `counter` with value `#{eval(${counter} + 1)}`|
